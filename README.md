# GAN
It is a project using GAN (Generative Asversarial Network) and training by CIFAR-10 dataset.<br>

### 1.Computer Environment
The need of detailed information of training envionment could been seen as follows.
[Paddlepaddle](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle), one of the most mature and perfect deep learning framework in China, as similar as Pytorch, has been repidly debeloping in recent years. 
Due to large dataset in CIFAR-10, GPU is needed in training. By the way, [Baidu AIstudio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/index)  provides free GPU and programing environment for registrars.
| Framework | Language | GPU | Dataset |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Paddlepaddle | python3.7 | True | CIFAR-10 |

### 3.TRIAN
Jupyter NoteBook, a training platform, is used to program and run code. Therefore, you can see the 12345 in CIFAR-10-GAN , which is different cell of Jupyter NoteBook.<br>
The image of trianing result are listed as follows.<br>
